# PathFinders
Initially a class project that I added onto and built upon over time, this program is a visually engaging and interactive program that generates random mazes and allows usthe user to solve them using a variety of pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

- **Random Maze Generation**
  - Creates new mazes with guaranteed solvability.
  - Adjustable maze complexity and size.

- **Multiple Solving Algorithms**
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **A* Search**
  - **Bidirectional Search**
  - **Simulated Annealing**
  - **Dijkstra**

- **Interactive UI**
  - Select and switch between different algorithms seamlessly.
  - Generate new mazes on-the-fly.
  - Visual feedback with hover effects and animated path tracing.

- **Cyberpunk-Inspired Visuals**
  - Neon colors with glow effects.
  - Animated markers for start and goal points.
  - Dynamic background with perspective grid lines.

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Pre-rendered glow surfaces for smooth visuals.
  - Safeguards like timeouts and iteration limits to ensure responsiveness.

- **Error Handling**
  - Graceful display of error messages.
  - Prevents application crashes with robust exception management.
